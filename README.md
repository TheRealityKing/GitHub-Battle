# GitHub-Battle
Battle your friends [here](https://www.chadwelch.us/github-battle) by comparing Github Accounts.

This is the first website that I have created using the React Javascript Library.
GitHub-Battle is a purely client side SPA, this means there is no server
rendered HTML sent to the client. This is bad for search engine optimization, but
allows me to host Github-Battle cheap - as static website on Google Cloud.
